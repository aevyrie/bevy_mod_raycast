# 0.5.0

- All internal debug related code is now behind feature flags to enable running with
  `default_features = false`. 
- Renamed:
  - `RayCastSource` to `RaycastSource`
  - `RayCastMesh` to `RaycastMesh`
  - `RayCastMethod` to `RaycastMethod`
  - `RayCastSet` to `RaycastSet`
- Update method naming to be more consistent with the ecosystem:
  - `intersect_list()` -> `get_intersections()`
  - `intersect_top()` -> `get_nearest_intersection()`
  - `ray()` -> `get_ray()`
- Added `intersections()`, the counterpart to `get_intersections()`. This method returns an empty
  slice if there are no intersections, instead of an `Option`. The latter is useful if you want a
  guarantee that there is at least one intersection after unwrapping the `Option`.
